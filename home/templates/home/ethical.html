        <h1 class="mb-4">Charter for the Creation of a Standards Body to Monitor and Test AI and ML Models for Gender,
            Cultural Bias, and Equity</h1>
        <p>
            We, the undersigned AI and technology enthusiasts, envision a world where artificial intelligence (AI) and
            machine learning (ML) technologies are developed and deployed with fairness, equity, and inclusivity. To
            achieve this, we propose the establishment of a standards body dedicated to impartially monitoring and
            testing AI and ML models for potential biases related to gender, culture, and equity. The purpose of this
            charter is to outline the principles and guidelines of this body, which will be responsible for creating
            and enforcing a comprehensive set of standards and certifications in collaboration with AI companies and
            experts.
        </p>
